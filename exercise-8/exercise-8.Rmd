## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
# bar graph - make with barplot()
# box plot - make with boxplot()
# scatterplot - make with plot()

#histogram - make with hist()

hist(sizes_in_94, xlab = "DBH (mm)", main = "Distribution of Tree Sizes in Cocoli (1994)")
?hist

plot(x = sizes_in_94, y = sizes_in_97, main = "Scatterplot of Sizes", xlab = "Sizes in 1994 (mm)", ylab = "Sizes in 1997 (mm)", pch = 19, col = "darkblue", log = "xy")

```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

# %>% is identical to the | in the terminal
cocoli_dat %>% filter(sizes_in_94 > 0) %>% arrange(-dbh1) %>% select(spcode)
cocoli_dat %>% filter(sizes_in_94 > 0) %>% group_by(spcode) %>% summarize(sum_dbh_1994 = sum(dbh1)) %>% arrange(-sum_dbh_1994)

```
